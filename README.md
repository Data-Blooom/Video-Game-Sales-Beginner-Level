## 🔍 Step 1: Data Cleaning – From Chaos to Ready-to-Use

Before any analysis, I cleaned the data like mining for gold:

- **Remove irrelevant columns:**  
Columns like `img` (game image) and `last_update` were removed.

- **Handle duplicate data:**  
942 duplicate or incomplete game entries were removed.

- **Rename columns for clarity:**  
For example, `jp_sales` was renamed to "Japan Sales" for better understanding.

- **Final save:**  
Cleaned data was saved in `Cleaned Game.xlsx` to use in Power BI. 🪄
